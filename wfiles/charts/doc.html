<graph> Attributes
The <graph> element for this chart can have the following properties:

Background Properties

    bgColor="HexColorCode" : This attribute sets the background color for the chart. You can set any hex color code as the value of this attribute. Remember that you DO NOT need to assign a "#" at the beginning of the hex color code. In fact, whenever you need to provide any hex color code in FusionCharts XML data document, you do not have to assign the # at the beginning.
    bgAlpha="NumericalValue(0-100)" : This attribute helps you set the alpha (transparency) of the graph. This is particularly useful when you need to load the chart in one of your Flash movies or when you want to set a background image (.swf) for the chart.
    bgSWF="Path of SWF File" : This attribute helps you load an external .swf file as a background for the chart.

Canvas Properties

    canvasBgColor="HexColorCode" : This attribute helps you set the background color of the canvas.
    canvasBgAlpha="NumericalValue(0-100)" : This attribute helps you set the alpha (transparency) of the canvas.
    canvasBorderColor="HexColorCode" : This attribute helps you set the border color of the canvas.
    canvasBorderThickness="NumericalValue(0-100)" : This attribute helps you set the border thickness (in pixels) of the canvas.

Chart and Axis Titles

    caption="String" : This attribute determines the caption of the chart that would appear at the top of the chart.
    subCaption="String" : Sub-caption of the chart
    xAxisName= "String" : x-Axis text title (if the chart supports axis)
    yAxisName= "String" : y-Axis text title (if the chart supports axis)

Chart Numerical Limits

    yAxisMinValue="value": This attribute determines the lower limit of y-axis.
    yAxisMaxValue="value" : This attribute determines the upper limit of y-axis.
    If you don't specify any of the above values, it is automatically calculated by FusionCharts based on the data provided by you.

Generic Properties

    shownames="1/0" : This attribute can have either of the two possible values: 1,0. It sets the configuration whether the x-axis values (for the data sets) will be displayed or not. By default, this attribute assumes the value 1, which means that the x-axis names will be displayed.
    showValues="1/0" : This attribute can have either of the two possible values: 1,0. It sets the configuration whether the data numerical values will be displayed along with the columns, bars, lines and the pies. By default, this attribute assumes the value 1, which means that the values will be displayed.
    showLimits="1/0" : Option whether to show/hide the chart limit textboxes.
    rotateNames="1/0" : Configuration that sets whether the category name text boxes would be rotated or not.
    showLegend="1/0" : This attribute sets whether the legend would be displayed at the bottom of the chart.
    textGap="Numeric Value": Distance between the edge of radar and the labels.

Radar Properties

    radarRadius="Numeric Value": FusionCharts automatically calculates the best fit radar radius for the chart. However, if you want to enforce one of your own radius values, you can set it using this attribute.
    radarFillColor="Hex Color" : This attribute lets you set the fill (background color) for the main radar (the outermost polygon).
    radarFillAlpha="0-100" : This attribute lets you set the transparency for the main radar.
    radarBorderColor="Hex Color" : This attribute lets you set the border color for the main radar.
    radarBorderThickness="Numeric Value" : : This attribute lets you set the border thickness for the main radar.
    radarInLineAlpha="0-100" : This attribute lets you set the transparency of lines joining the vertex of the radar and center.

Line Properties

    lineColor="Hex Code" : If you want the entire radar lines to be plotted in one color, set that color for this attribute.
    lineThickness="Numeric Value" : Thickness of the line (in pixels).
    lineAlpha="0-100" : Transparency of the line.

Anchor properties
Anchors (or the marker points) are the polygons which appear at the joint of two consecutive lines. On a line chart, the anchors are the elements which react to the hover caption and link for that particular data point. You can customize all the facets of the anchors using the properties below:

    showAnchors="1/0": Configuration whether the anchors would be shown on the chart or not. If the anchors are not shown, then the hover caption and link functions won't work.
    anchorSides="Numeric Value greater than 3": This attribute sets the number of sides the anchor will have. For e.g., an anchor with 3 sides would represent a triangle, with 4 it would be a square and so on.
    anchorRadius="Numeric Value" : This attribute sets the radius (in pixels) of the anchor. Greater the radius, bigger would be the anchor size.
    anchorBorderColor="Hex Code" : Border Color of the anchor.
    anchorBgColor="Hex Code" : Background color of the anchor.
    anchorAlpha="Numeric Value" : This function lets you set the tranparency of the entire anchor (including the border). This attribute is particularly useful, when you do not want the anchors to be visible on the chart, but you want the hover caption and link functionality. In that case, you can set anchorAlpha to 0.

Font Properties

    baseFont="FontName" : This attribute sets the base font family of the chart font which lies on the canvas i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie on the canvas will be displayed using the font name provided here.
    baseFontSize="FontSize" : This attribute sets the base font size of the chart i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie on the canvas will be displayed using the font size provided here.
    baseFontColor="HexColorCode" : This attribute sets the base font color of the chart i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie on the canvas will be displayed using the font color provided here.
    outCnvBaseFont = "FontName" : This attribute sets the base font family of the chart font which lies outside the canvas i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie outside the canvas will be displayed using the font name provided here.
    outCnvBaseFontSze="FontSize" : This attribute sets the base font size of the chart i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie outside the canvas will be displayed using the font size provided here.
    outCnvBaseFontColor="HexColorCode": This attribute sets the base font color of the chart i.e., all the values and the names in the chart which lie outside the canvas will be displayed using the font color provided here.

Number Formatting Options

    numberPrefix="$" : Using this attribute, you could add prefix to all the numbers visible on the graph. For example, to represent all dollars figure on the chart, you could specify this attribute to ' $' to show like $40000, $50000.
    numberSuffix="p.a" : Using this attribute, you could add prefix to all the numbers visible on the graph. For example, to represent all figure quantified as per annum on the chart, you could specify this attribute to ' /a' to show like 40000/a, 50000/a.
    To use special characters for numberPrefix or numberSuffix, you'll need to URL Encode them. That is, suppose you wish to have numberSuffix as % (like 30%), you'll need to specify it as under:
    numberSuffix='%25'
    formatNumber="1/0" : This configuration determines whether the numbers displayed on the chart will be formatted using commas, e.g., 40,000 if formatNumber='1' and 40000 if formatNumber='0 '
    formatNumberScale="1/0" : Configuration whether to add K (thousands) and M (millions) to a number after truncating and rounding it - e.g., if formatNumberScale is set to 1, 10434 would become 1.04K (with decimalPrecision set to 2 places). Same with numbers in millions - a M will added at the end.
    decimalSeparator="." : This option helps you specify the character to be used as the decimal separator in a number.
    thousandSeparator="," : This option helps you specify the character to be used as the thousands separator in a number.
    decimalPrecision="2" : Number of decimal places to which all numbers on the chart would be rounded to.
    divLineDecimalPrecision="2": Number of decimal places to which all divisional line (horizontal) values on the chart would be rounded to.
    limitsDecimalPrecision="2" : Number of decimal places to which upper and lower limit values on the chart would be rounded to.

Divisional Lines

Divisional Lines are radar shaped polygons concentric to the main radar. Each divisional line signfies a smaller unit of the entire axis thus aiding the users in interpreting the chart.

    numdivlines="NumericalValue" : This attribute sets the number of divisional lines to be drawn.
    divlinecolor="HexColorCode" : The color of grid divisional line.
    divLineThickness="NumericalValue" : Thickness (in pixels) of the grid divisional line.
    divLineAlpha="NumericalValue0-100" : Alpha (transparency) of the grid divisional line.
    showDivLineValue="1/0" : Option to show/hide the textual value of the divisional line.

Hover Caption Properties

The hover caption is the tool tip which shows up when the user moves his mouse over a particular data item (column, line, pie, bar etc.).

    showhovercap="1/0" : Option whether to show/hide hover caption box.
    hoverCapBgColor="HexColorCode" : Background color of the hover caption box.
    hoverCapBorderColor="HexColorCode" : Border color of the hover caption box.
    hoverCapSepChar="Char" : The character specified as the value of this attribute separates the name and value displayed in the hover caption box.

Chart Margins

Chart Margins refers to the empty space left on the top, bottom, left and right of the chart. That means, FusionCharts would leave that much amount of empty space on the chart, before it starts plotting.

    chartLeftMargin="Numerical Value (in pixels)" : Space to be left unplotted on the left side of the chart.
    chartRightMargin="Numerical Value (in pixels)" : Empty space to be left on the right side of the chart
    chartTopMargin="Numerical Value (in pixels)" : Empty space to be left on the top of the chart.
    chartBottomMargin="Numerical Value (in pixels)" : Empty space to be left at the bottom of the chart.

 
<categories> element

The <categories> element can have the following attributes:

    font="font face" : Font face of the category names.
    fontSize="Numeric value" : Font size of the category names.
    fontColor="Hex Color" : Font color of the category names.

 
<category> element
Each <category> element represents a x-axis data label. You can specify the following attributes for <category> element:

    name="String" : This attribute determines the category name which would be displayed on the x-axis as the data label. In our example, we've specified the category names as names of six months (in abbreviated format).
    hoverText="String" : Sometimes, you might just want to show the abbreviated names on the x-axis (to avoid cluttering or to make the chart look more legible). However, you still have the option of showing the full name as tool tip using this attribute. Like, in our example, we're showing the abbreviated form "Jan" on our x-axis, but the full word "January" is shown as the tool tip.
    showName="1/0" : This attribute can either the value of 0 or 1. A value of 1 indicates that this data label/category name will be displayed on the chart whereas 0 indicates it won't be displayed. This attribute is particular useful when you want to show/hide names of alternate data items or say every x (th) data item.

<dataset> element

The following attributes can be defined for the <dataset> element.

    seriesName="String" : This attribute denotes the name of the dataset series. That is, if we're plotting a monthly sales analysis for the years 2004 and 2003, the seriesName for the first dataset would be 2004 and that of the second would be 2003. This is the value that would be shown in the legend.
    color="Hex Color" : This attribute sets the color using which that particular set of data would be drawn.
    showValues="1/0": This attribute sets the configuration whether the values (for this particular data set) will be shown alongside the data sets. You can set this value for individual datasets to highlight the most prominent data.

Dataset specific anchor properties
The anchor properties below would be applicable for anchor of this particular dataset only.

    showAnchors="1/0": Configuration whether the anchors would be shown for this dataset or not. If the anchors are not shown, then the hover caption and link functions won't work.
    anchorSides="Numeric Value greater than 3": This attribute sets the number of sides the anchors (of this dataset) will have. For e.g., an anchor with 3 sides would represent a triangle, with 4 it would be a square and so on.
    anchorRadius="Numeric Value" : This attribute sets the radius (in pixels) of the anchor. Greater the radius, bigger would be the anchor size.
    anchorBorderColor="Hex Code" : Border Color of the anchor.
    anchorBgColor="Hex Code" : Background color of the anchor.
    anchorBgAlpha="Numeric Value" : Alpha of the anchor background.
    anchorAlpha="Numeric Value" : This function lets you set the tranparency of the entire anchor (including the border). This attribute is particularly useful, when you do not want the anchors to be visible on the chart, but you want the hover caption and link functionality. In that case, you can set anchorAlpha to 0.

Dataset specific line properties

    lineThickness="Numeric Value" : Thickness of the line (in pixels).
    lineAlpha="0-100" : Transparency of the line (in pixels).

<set> element

We now move on to the <set> element which is a child element of the <dataset> element and determines a set of data which would appear on the graph.

A <set> element looks as under:
<set value="54" link="ShowDetails.asp%3FMonth=Jan" />

Now let's study the the possible attributes of the <set> element:

    value="NumericalValue"
    Example: <set name='Jan' value='12345' ...>
    This attribute determines the numerical value for the set of data according to which the chart would be built for the concerned set of data.
    link="URL"
    Example: <set … link='ShowDetails.asp%3FMonth=Jan' ...>
    This attribute defines the hotspots in your graph. The hotspots are links over the data sets. Please note that you'll need to URL Encode all the special characters (like ? and &) present in the link.All the server side scripting languages provide a generic function to URL Encode any string - like in ASP and ASP.NET, we've Server.URLEncode(strURL) and so on.

    To open a link in a new window, just put n- in front of the link e.g., link="n-ShowDetails.asp%3FMonth=Jan".

At the end of the <set> element, you would find a "/" which signals that it has no more child element. At the end of the data file, you would find a </graph> element, which signals the end of the data file for the graph.
